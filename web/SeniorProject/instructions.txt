HOW TO PLAY MILLE BORNES:

You are on a cross country drive. The goal of the game is to drive 1000 miles before your opponent(s).

Each of you have 3 piles beside you - the Drive Pile, the Speed Pile, and the Miles Pile. There are also 3 types of cards - attack cards are red, remedy cards are green, and mile cards are blue. You play attack cards on your opponent's piles and remedy and mile cards on your own piles.

ON YOUR TURN:
- Click the draw pile or discard pile to DRAW a card
- SELECT the card you want to use from your hand by clicking on it
- PLAY or DISCARD the card by clicking on a valid area (highlighted in white)

A DRIVE card MUST be played on your Drive Pile before you will be allowed to play any mile cards. 

If your opponent plays an attack card on your drive pile, you will be unable to drive any more miles until you play the corresponding remedy on your drive pile so it is green again.

If your Speed Pile is red, you can only play mile cards with value 50 or less (assuming you can play cards, because your Drive Pile is green. If your Drive Pile is red, you can't play any mile cards, regardless of if you have a Speed Limit on you).

The first player to reach 1000 miles or more WINS!
